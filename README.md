# 🚀 ExploreUI - The Evolution of UI Across Different Eras

Welcome to **ExploreUI**, a unique and interactive journey through the history of **User Interface (UI) Design** across different eras! 🎨💻 This project showcases the progression of web design from the **1990s to the modern day**, featuring distinct styles, functionalities, and interactive elements. 

---
## 📌 **Project Overview**
ExploreUI is designed to **educate** and **engage** users by simulating the UI experience of three distinct periods:

🖥️ **1990s (Web 1.0)** – Represented by the **NCSA Mosaic** browser style.  
📜 **Early 2000s (Skeuomorphic Design)** – Modeled after early web portals with **rich, textured interfaces**.  
🌐 **Modern Era (Minimalism)** – Styled as a **Chrome browser** window displaying a **contemporary Apple website design**.

🔹 Each section includes **interactive elements** such as **draggable and resizable windows**, navigation tools, and animations to enhance the user experience.
