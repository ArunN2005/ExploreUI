ExploreUI - The Evolution of UI Across Different Eras
Welcome to ExploreUI, a unique webpage that takes you on an interactive journey through the history and evolution of user interface (UI) design across different eras. This project showcases the progression of web design from the 1990s to the modern day, featuring distinct styles and functionalities for each era.

Project Overview
ExploreUI is designed to educate and engage users by simulating the UI experience of three distinct periods:

1990s (Web 1.0): Represented by the NCSA Mosaic browser style.
Early 2000s (Skeuomorphic Design): Modeled after early web portals with rich, textured interfaces.
Modern Era (Minimalism): Styled as a Chrome browser window displaying a contemporary Apple website design.
Each section includes interactive elements such as draggable and resizable windows (where applicable), navigation tools, and animations to enhance the user experience.

Features
Era-Based UI Simulation:
1990s: A retro NCSA Mosaic window with basic navigation (back, forward, home, refresh).
2000s: A skeuomorphic web portal with navigation and a clickable button.
Modern: A Chrome browser-like interface showcasing an Apple website with fade-in animations and hover effects.
Interactive Elements:
Draggable Windows: Move any window within its section.
Resizable Windows: Resize windows for the 1990s and 2000s sections (modern section is fixed to mimic a browser).
Navigation: Use toolbar buttons (back, forward, home, refresh) to navigate within each era's content.
Animations: Smooth fade-in effects for modern section content as you scroll.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, with full-screen sections for each era.
How to Use
Open the Project:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Explore the Eras:
Scroll down to transition between the 1990s, 2000s, and modern sections.
Each section features a simulated window with era-specific styling.
Interact with the Interface:
Drag: Click and hold the title bar (or chrome frame for modern) to move the window.
Resize: Click and drag the bottom-right corner of the 1990s and 2000s windows to resize.
Navigate: Use the toolbar buttons to move between pages within each era (e.g., home to news).
Watch Animations: Scroll through the modern section to see content fade in.
